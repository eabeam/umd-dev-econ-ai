# Research Decisions Log — Template

*Cleaning and variable-construction choices are research decisions. This log makes them visible — including the ones an AI agent made on your behalf: when an agent writes your cleaning code, audit it for imputations, dropped observations, and recodes, and log each one below as if you had made it yourself. (You did.)*

## Instructions

For each data quality issue you identify, document your decision below. There are no universally "correct" answers to cleaning decisions — but every decision must be justified and its consequences understood.

Before filling this out, explore the data using `summarize`, `tabulate`, `codebook`, or equivalent commands. Ask AI to help you flag potential issues, but make all final decisions yourself.

## Column Guide

- **What I Found**: Describe the issue precisely (e.g., "3 respondents with earnings > 500,000; median earnings is 17,000")
- **Decision**: What you did (e.g., "Winsorized at 99th percentile", "Dropped observation", "Recoded to missing", "Kept as-is")
- **Justification**: Why this is the right call for your analysis (e.g., "Likely data entry error based on context", "Value is plausible for a business owner")
- **Alternative Considered**: What else you could have done and why you didn't
- **Sample Size Impact**: How many observations are affected (e.g., "3 observations recoded", "Dropped 12 obs, N goes from 500 to 488")
